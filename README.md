🏙️ Town Management System
📌 Overview

The Town Management System is a modular project built in C (backend with Data Structures) and Python (frontend GUI with Tkinter).
It simulates the administration of a town by managing:

👨‍👩‍👧 Citizens

The project is designed to demonstrate the use of Data Structures (DSA) in real-world scenarios like managing records, networks, and services.
